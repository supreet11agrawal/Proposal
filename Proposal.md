### Programming Background

I am a third year undergraduate student of Chemical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India

I am using Ubuntu 18.04 (LTS), and Atom for writing all of my code. I am using this setup for last 3 years and in this duration I have become quite comfortable with it. For the purpose of debugging, I use PDB, to which I was introduced via Kalevi Suominen while working on an issue.

Despite being a student of Chemical Engineering department, my main interest has always been in Mathematics and Computer Science. Beacuse of this interest I have taken multiple courses in Mathematics department and Computer Science department.

Few of these courses are :
* Probability and Statistics
* Linear Algebra and Complex Analysis
* Fundamentals of Computing
* Game Theory and Mechanism Design
* Computational Methods in Engineering

As I have mentioned above, my coursework in Probability and Statistics helped me learn a lot in the field and will help me directly in the Summer of Code project.

I was introduced to Python two years ago. However, I am relatively new in terms of object oriented programming. Prior to working in Python, my programming experience was confined to C and C++. In comparison to these languages, Python is much more intuitive. In my opinion, Python is more expressive than any other language I have used. According to me, list comprehension is one of the best features which I have used.

My favourite feature about Sympy is it's ability to compute asymptotic series expansions of functions around a point. I came across this feature while getting acquainted with the library. Sympy's ability to compute serie expansions left me awestruck and inspired to learn more about Sympy.
